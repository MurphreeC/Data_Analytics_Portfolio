# Data_Analytics_Portfolio
Hi I'm Curtis, currently own and operate 2 food trucks.
I am also completing Google's Data Analtyics Certificate
I plan to use this for my current business, but am open to other opportunities.
I am excited and interested in how to apply this to the sports and entertainment world, as well as distaster prediction.

I plan on uploading my course work as I go.
